# The Gutters Green

## A business website for a company that cleans, repairs, and installs gutters.

Built with Nuxt.js, this project uses the git based CMS Nuxt/Content to power a blog that provides current and potential customers with a rich supply of gutter knowledge. 

The UI is largely made up of components from TailwindUI.
