description:  little about who I am and my experience in gutters

I have 5 years experience designing and installing gutter systems as a site foreman, sandwhiched between 6 years of cleaning roofs and gutters. I've seen it all. I've cleared every clog, reached every inch of roof, and in every kind of weather. Few are my peers when it comes to setting up and using fall protection.
