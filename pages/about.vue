            <h1 class="mt-2 text-pretty text-4xl font-semibold tracking-tight text-gray-900 sm:text-5xl">The Company</h1>
            <p class="mt-6 text-xl/8 text-gray-700">The Gutters Green LLC specializes in the professional installation of seamless gutters, gutter repairs, modifications, gutter cleaning, and roof cleaning. With over a decade of hands-on experience, I’ve developed expertise in all aspects of gutter systems, ensuring high-quality service and customer satisfaction.</p>
            <h2 class="mt-6 text-pretty text-4xl font-semibold tracking-tight text-gray-900 sm:text-5xl">My Story</h2>
            <p class="mt-8 text-gray-700">My journey in the gutter industry began in 2012 when I worked for a leading gutter material supplier. This role allowed me to become well-versed in all aspects of gutter components, accessories, and terminology. More importantly, it introduced me to the skilled professionals who make up the backbone of this industry—the gutter installers.</p>
            <p class="mt-8 text-gray-700">In 2015, I joined a prestigious gutter and roof cleaning company, where I received advanced fall protection training, a skill set that has been foundational throughout my career. It was during this time that I discovered my passion for delivering more than just a service—I enjoyed creating a memorable and positive experience for every customer.</p>
            <p class="mt-8 text-gray-700">A few years later, I transitioned to the gutter division of a respected roofing company. My proficiency with ropes and ladders quickly set me apart, and I was entrusted with my own truck, gutter machine, and crew to manage. This position also reconnected me with many industry professionals as we regularly crossed paths while sourcing materials.</p>
            <p class="mt-8 text-gray-700">In the years that followed, I ventured into building something of my own. I was fortunate to work with various construction and gutter companies, often through friends who valued my expertise. These collaborations gave me firsthand exposure to the approaches of both seasoned veterans and ambitious startups in the gutter industry.</p>
